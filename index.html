    <h1>Qahwa | Arabic Coffee</h1>

    <div class="block">
      <p>
        Coffee is my passion and hobby. Let me tell you about my favourite one -
        qahwa.
      </p>

      <p>
        Qahwa (also known as kahwa or Arabic coffee) is a traditional method of
        preparing coffee in the Middle East â€“ with each country generally having
        its own unique recipe.
      </p>

      <p>
        Qahwa is made from green coffee beans and cardamom. It is often served
        with dates. It is served from a special coffee pot called dallah and the
        cups are small with no handle. It is also offered at most social events
        like weddings or parties. Qahwa is popularly consumed after breaking the
        fast (Iftar) during Ramadan.

      <h2>How to make Qahwa</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Bring water to boil in a saucepan. When it boils, add ground coffee.
        </li>
        <li>
          After 10 minutes of boiling, add cloves, crushed cardamom and stir
          once and boil for another 4 to 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now switch off the flame, cover and let coffee grounds settle at the
          bottom for a minute. Do not stir at this time since the liquid needs
          to settle.
        </li>
        <li>Now add the rose water and saffron if you are using them.</li>
        <li>Strain and pour the steaming coffee into the flask or teapot.</li>
        <li>
          Now qahwa is ready to be served. Serve with dates during evenings and
          enjoy!
        </li>
      </ol>
